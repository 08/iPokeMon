# Description

### About App

> iPokeMon is a PokéMon game on iOS with Location Based Service, i.e., PokeMons are distributed in the real world. You'll find different PokeMons in different cities, or even countries.  

> Just imagine that we live with PokeMons in real world. ;)

> [SERVER SIDE SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon-Server).

### About Project

> This was my Graduation Project. I tried to submit it to the App Store when the v0.3.2 done, but finally, the binary was rejected on May 16, 2012 with the reason of rejection: "8.5: Use of protected 3rd party material (trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, otherwise proprietary content) requires a documented rights check which must be provided upon request". What a pity! There was a time I wanted to ask some designers to create a set of PokéMon like characters, but I gave up the thought cause it'll lose its meaning then. So after I graduated from university on Jun, 2012, I shelved this project for several months.  

> Till now, I still hope to have such a game on iOS. With my own limited capacity, iPokeMon is still in beta version. So I open source this whole project in order to let more and more people (both programmer & designer, or even just a player are all welcomed) participate in the development. I look forward to that one day it can be owned by everyone that grown up with PokéMon!

> Finally, I would like to say that feel free to transplant this project to any system! And I'll be glad if you send me a mail about your transplanting. ;)

# Make Contributions

If you have some spare time then there is no better way to help an open source project than to get involved at one level or another. Contributions are very much appreciated and needed in any of the following ways:

  - Improve the source code;
  - Help diagnose and report problems;
  - Suggest fixes by sending in patches;
  - Help with unit and end-to-end testing;
  - Provide peer support on our forum or on the Sencha forum;
  - Publish an article on your blog (send the link) to educate others regarding some aspect of the project;
  - Help with missing documentation;
  - Improve the game data.

For programmers, if you want to be a contributor of the source code, just fork this repo as your own and improve the code in your own repo. When you done, send a "Pull Request" to me. I'll merge the commits after checking. And b.t.w, it is better to send "Pull Request" whenever you've modify the source code, even a modification of one word. :)

And for designers, feel free to discuss with me on the design work via email: `kj#kjuly.com`.

I collected the original data of iPokeMon on the internet. Most of them are okay, but of course, the lack is also hard to avoid. So I'm glad that you can help me to improve the data.

As an independent developer, I need some support with microdonations to continue the project. Your monetary support is greatly appreciated!

<img src="http://api.flattr.com/button/flattr-badge-large.png" alt="Flattr this" title="Flattr this" border="0" />
</a>

As an another way to support me, you can purchase any of my iOS Apps which are sold on the AppStore ([https://itunes.apple.com/artist/kaijie-yu/id523484108](https://itunes.apple.com/artist/kaijie-yu/id523484108)), or just share this page to your friends via _Twitter_, _Facebook_, _Google+_, etc.

Thanks in advance! <3
