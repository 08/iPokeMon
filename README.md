The center button is the `Main Button` in App, you can open menu by pressing it. And the button above is a `Map Button`, the default color is red, that means `Location Service` is disabled, you can turn it on by keeping pressing on it with 3 seconds, and it'll change to white color.

## Battle with Wild Pokemon Part:

  You should enable `Location Service` when you playing the game. When a Wild Pokemon appeared, the `Main Button` will change its status, you can press it and enter the game battle scene. Just like the screenshots shown above.  

  In game battle scene, you can input gestures listed below:
- __Swipe to right__: open `Move View`.
- __Swipe to left__: open `Bag View`.
