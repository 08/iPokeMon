You'll find different PokeMons in different cities, or even countries.  \r\n\r\n> Just imagine that we live with PokeMons in real world. ;)\r\n\r\n> [SERVER SIDE SOURCE CODE](https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon-Server).\r\n\r\n### About Project\r\n\r\n> This was my Graduation Project. I tried to submit it to the App Store when the v0.3.2 done, but finally, the binary was rejected on May 16, 2012 with the reason of rejection: \"8.5: Use of protected 3rd party material (trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, otherwise proprietary content) requires a documented rights check which must be provided upon request\". What a pity! There was a time I wanted to ask some designers to create a set of PokéMon like characters, but I gave up the thought cause it'll lose its meaning then. So after I graduated from university on Jun, 2012, I shelved this project for several months.  \r\n\r\n> Till now, I still hope to have such a game on iOS. With my own limited capacity, iPokeMon is still in beta version. So I open source this whole project in order to let more and more people (both programmer & designer, or even just a player are all welcomed) participate in the development. I look forward to that one day it can be owned by everyone that grown up with PokéMon!\r\n\r\n> Finally, I would like to say that feel free to transplant this project to any system! And I'll be glad if you send me a mail about your transplanting. ;)\r\n\r\n---\r\n# Demo\r\n\r\n- [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otiBQnwdt0U) - 2012-05-09\r\n- [Youku](http://v.youku.com/v_show/id_XNDA1MjExMDg4.html) - 2012-06-03 (Newer)\r\n\r\n---\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n### Root Manage View\r\n\r\n<a  href=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM/01_00_root_manage_view_without_lbs.png\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM_small/01_00_root_manage_view_without_lbs.png\"\r\ntitle=\"Root Manage View without LBS\"/>\r\n</a>\r\n<a  href=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM/01_01_root_manage_view_with_lbs.png\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM_small/01_01_root_manage_view_with_lbs.png\" \r\ntitle=\"Root Manage View with LBS\">\r\n</a>\r\n<a  href=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM/01_02_root_manage_view_with_lbs_pm_appeared.png\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM_small/01_02_root_manage_view_with_lbs_pm_appeared.png\" \r\ntitle=\"Root Manage View with LBS PokeMon Appeared\">\r\n</a>\r\n<a  href=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM/02_00_00_root_circle_menu.png\">\r\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Kjuly/iPokeMon/raw/gh-pages/images/iPM_small/02_00_00_root_circle_menu.png\" \r\ntitle=\"Root Circle Menu\">\r\n</a>\r\n\r\n### Main Circle Menu\r\n\r\nThe center button is the __\"Main Button\"___ in App, you can open the main circle menu by pressing it.
